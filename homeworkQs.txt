What might happen if we just created the date as a new date (every time) 
in the wakeup function? Why does this make it difficult to test the function?
So the code might look like this:

function wakeup() {

    const currentHour = new Date().getHours();

    if(currentHour > 12 ) {
        return "Ugggggh its too early - I'm not waking up yet";
    }
    else {
        return "Get up!! You're wasting the day";
    }
}

Is it because it would change every time you ran it so it would pass at some time of day but not others
I.e. you could get a false positive/ false negative result?
